PNG/BMP -> Vector File
With Vector images we can scale them without worrying about the resolution while PNG/BMP would either scale horribly or require multiple images in diffrent resolutions. 

To Convert a PNG/BMP file throw it into Inkscape 
	Click Ctrl+A which will select the image 
	Go to Path->Trace Bitmap
		Select Color, and Remove Background (Seems to loose some color) 
	Save As inkscpe.svg

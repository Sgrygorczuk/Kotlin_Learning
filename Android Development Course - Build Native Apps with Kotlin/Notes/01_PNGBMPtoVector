PNG/BMP -> Vector File
With Vector images we can scale them without worrying about the resolution while PNG/BMP would either scale horribly or require multiple images in diffrent resolutions. 

To Convert a PNG/BMP file throw it into Inkscape 
	Click Ctrl+A which will select the image 
	Go to Path->Trace Bitmap
		Select Color, and Remove Background (Seems to loose some color) 
	Save As inkscpe.svg


To upload a svg file to andoird Studio go to drawble folder click New->Vectoe Asset and it will allow you to import the vector image. This will give you a new xml file.

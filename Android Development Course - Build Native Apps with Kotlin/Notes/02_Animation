To create an animation you simiply go to drawbles and create a new xml file

There you will change it from <selector to <animation-list
And you will proccedd to list the items you wish to be part of that list 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<animation-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_space_bg_one" android:duration="500"/>
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_space_bg_two" android:duration="200"/>
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/ic_space_bg_three" android:duration="200"/>
 </animation-list>

The duration is around half a second 

Then you will want to place the items into a activity as an imageView which is connected to the aniamtion xml file. 

Lastly to actiave the animation you will have to go to the Kotlin file that's connected to that activity page and write 
 
	Id		
(bg_animation.drawable as AnimationDrawable).start()

This will make the animation run indeifently
